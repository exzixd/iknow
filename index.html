          <p>
            Hi there! My name is Luna, and I'm a 17-year-old ethical hacker and
            programmer who loves coffee milk!
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm an outgoing person who loves to meet new people and learn about
            different cultures. In my free time, I enjoy reading books, playing
            video games, and exploring nature. I'm also a big fan of music and
            love to attend concerts whenever I can. In addition, I'm an activist
            for freedom and strongly believe in the importance of free internet
            access for all. I fight against censorship and strive to promote
            open communication and the sharing of information.
          </p>
          <p>I'm fine with She/Her, and They/Them pronouns.</p>
          <h2 id="languages-and-skills">Languages and Skills</h2>
          <p>
            I have a strong background in several programming languages,
            including C, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Lua, and Assembly.
            I'm also skilled in using markup and stylesheet languages like HTML
            and CSS to create and style web content. Currently, I'm learning
            Rust to expand my skillset. My experience spans both Linux and
            Windows environments, and I've worked with a variety of Linux
            distributions such as Arch, Gentoo, Slackware, Ubuntu, RHEL,
            OpenSUSE, Fedora, and Kali Linux.
          </p>
          <p>
            My main focus is on the Lua Compiler, but I also enjoy working on
            various side projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to my programming skills, I'm also experienced in using
            tools like Docker and Kubernetes. I know how to configure and set up
            Linux systems, and have experience compiling and configuring the
            kernel from source. I've even built my own Linux system from scratch
            by following the books
            <a href="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/"
              >Linux From Scratch</a
            >
            and
            <a href="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/"
              >Beyond Linux From Scratch</a
            >.

          <h2 id="ethical-hacking">Ethical Hacking</h2>
          <p>
            In addition to programming, I'm also passionate about ethical
            hacking. I'm proficient in Kali Linux and have developed scripts and
            programs to aid in ethical hacking endeavors. I have experience with
            Responsible Disclosure and Bug Bounty programs and have successfully
            identified and reported vulnerabilities for notable companies such
            as <a href="https://github.com">Github</a>,
            <a href="https://roblox.com">Roblox</a>, and
            <a href="https://shodan.io">Shodan</a>.
          </p>
          <h2 id="sharing-knowledge">Sharing Knowledge</h2>
          <p>
            I believe in the importance of sharing knowledge and am always eager
            to help others learn about ethical hacking, programming, or Linux.

            I also maintain a blog where I write about topics related to ethical
            hacking and programming.
